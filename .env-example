# Basic Authentication
# Format: PROJECT_NAME:username:password (separated by colons)
# Multiple projects can be defined, one per line
# Example:
# AUTH_PROJECT1=myproject:admin:securepassword123
# AUTH_PROJECT2=anotherproject:viewer:anotherpass456

# Define your projects here:
AUTH_PROJECT1=example-project:admin:changeme
AUTH_PROJECT2=demo-docs:user:password123

# Global authentication (optional)
# If set, this will protect ALL paths that don't have specific project auth
# Leave empty to disable global auth
AUTH_GLOBAL=

# Example with global auth enabled:
# AUTH_GLOBAL=admin:globalpassword

# These directories will be excluded from the auto-generated README.md index

# Default system directories to exclude (space-separated)
# These are typically static assets and error pages

# Custom directories to exclude (space-separated)
# Use this for ultra-secret projects or any custom directories you want to hide from the index
# Example: EXCLUDE_DIRS_CUSTOM=secret-project confidential another-hidden-dir
EXCLUDE_DIRS_CUSTOM=
