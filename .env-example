# DocsServe Configuration

# Environment Mode
# Determines which Docker Compose configuration to use
# - production: Standard deployment (default)
# - development: Enables hot-reload for nginx config (mounts default.conf as volume)
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Basic Authentication
# Format: PROJECT_NAME:username:password (separated by colons)
# Multiple projects can be defined, one per line
#
# VARIABLE NAMING CONVENTION (recommended for organization):
#   Pattern: AUTH_PROJECT_[PROJECTNAME]_[USERNAME]
#   Example: AUTH_PROJECT_MYAPP_ADMIN, AUTH_PROJECT_DOCS_VIEWER
#
#   Note: Any variable starting with "AUTH_PROJECT" will be processed.
#   Using descriptive names helps maintain order and enables quick searching.
#   You can also use simpler names like AUTH_PROJECT1, AUTH_PROJECT2, etc.
#
# SECURITY RECOMMENDATION: Use hashed passwords instead of plaintext
# Nginx supports Apache htpasswd-compatible password hashes (crypt, SHA, bcrypt)
#
# Generate hashed passwords using openssl:
#   SHA-512 (recommended):  openssl passwd -6 'yourpassword'
#   SHA-256:                openssl passwd -5 'yourpassword'
#   bcrypt:                 openssl passwd -apr1 'yourpassword'
#
# Example with plaintext:
# AUTH_PROJECT_MYPROJECT_ADMIN=myproject:admin:securepassword123
#
# Example with hashed password (SHA-512):
# AUTH_PROJECT_MYPROJECT_ADMIN=myproject:admin:$6$rounds=5000$salt$hashedpasswordhere
#
# Multiple projects can be defined, one per line
# Examples:
# AUTH_PROJECT_DOCS_ADMIN=documentation:admin:securepassword123
# AUTH_PROJECT_API_VIEWER=api-reference:viewer:anotherpass456
# AUTH_PROJECT_INTERNAL_DEVTEAM=internal-docs:devteam:teampassword

# Define your projects here:
AUTH_PROJECT_EXAMPLEPROJECT_ADMIN=example-project:admin:changeme
AUTH_PROJECT_DEMODOCS_USER=demo-docs:user:password123

# Global authentication (optional)
# If set, this will protect ALL paths that don't have specific project auth
# Leave empty to disable global auth
# Also supports hashed passwords (use openssl passwd -6 'yourpassword')
AUTH_GLOBAL=

# Example with global auth enabled (plaintext):
# AUTH_GLOBAL=admin:globalpassword
#
# Example with global auth enabled (hashed):
# AUTH_GLOBAL=admin:$6$rounds=5000$salt$hashedpasswordhere

# Directory Exclusions
# These directories will be excluded from the auto-generated README.md index

# Default system directories to exclude (space-separated)
# These are typically static assets and error pages
EXCLUDE_DIRS_DEFAULT=web

# Custom directories to exclude (space-separated)
# Use this for ultra-secret projects or any custom directories you want to hide from the index
# Example: EXCLUDE_DIRS_CUSTOM=secret-project confidential another-hidden-dir
EXCLUDE_DIRS_CUSTOM=
